# Specific to this project - do not commit large datasets
# If your datasets are small (like the ones chosen), you can remove these lines
# or comment them out if you want to include them in the Git repository.
# For now, let's assume you'll include them since they're relatively small.
# If your 'data/' folder ever gets huge, consider uncommenting the line below.
# data/

# If you want to explicitly ignore all CSV files (but you probably don't for 'data/')
# *.csv
